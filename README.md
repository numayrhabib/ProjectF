# ProjectF

# Usually you have the main/master branch which must always be stable and ready to deploy on the go
# Since this isnt a full-fledged product as of yet, we wont have branches like testing or prod. 
# Our equivalent of prod will be dev. All feature branches can put a PR on dev. Once approved,
# the changes are merged and the subsequent branch is deleted. It is expected of devs to then branch
# off of the latest dev and continue working on their features.

# We will stick to the following branch naming convention

# Feature branches

# "feature-X/someDescriptionOfFeature" , where X = the ticket number assigned by chosen project management tool

# Hotfix branches

# "hotfix/feature-X" , where X = the ticket number for which this hotfix is being pushed

# Approval of PR's will be handled by the scrum master as well as ticket assignment.
